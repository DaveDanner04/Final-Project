# Final-Project https://online.seterra.com/en/vgp/3003

My web map is a map of the united states. The objective of this map is to test the users knowlege of United states geography. The page will request the user to select a specific state, if the user selects correctly, it moves onto another state however it will not advance unil the user selects the correct state. 
Funtions- 

    The colors of the states change
    There is sound
    There are various game modes 
    When you guess incorrectly twice the state will turn yellow, if you guess incorrectly more than two times the correct state turns red once finally selected.
    Once you select the correct state, it will tell you the capital of that state
    There is a continuous timer that runs until you correctly guess all the states
    
Target Audience -

     This map could be used for anyone who is currious about United states geography. 
     This map could be used by anyone who is immegrating to American and needs to know more about their new country
     This activity reminds me of something we might have done in a middle school geography class.

   Data source-
   
        Vectors (polygons)
        
   Basemap, thematic layer, interactive features -
        
        Basemap is a classic United states map. This map has added windows to show Hawaii and Alaska. The Thematic layer is a simple green layer that cover the whole map until you start guessing states. Once states are guessed correctly on the first attempt the state will turn white. Each state is an interactive and clickable feature. There is a voice and sound feature along with a feature that allows you to change the game type. 
        
    Map Elements 
  
          This map is missing almost all of the necessary map elements. There is no scale bar, there is no legend, there is no North Arrow, and there really is no title on the actual map itself. If you select the mode show all, it will label each state which is somewhat of a legend. For this map, it isnt super important to have a north arrow or a scale bar simply because its key purpose is to learn the names of the states. The most important thing is to have accurate size representation considering the purpose of this map. 
          
    Improvments -
            I think this map would be better if canada and mexico were different colors from America because the focuse of the map is the united states. Another huge imporovment would be to put Alaska and Hawaii in their respective locations. For someone learning the states it makes sense to learn where they actually are located. I think if they added a game mode that would focus on different regions would be a big imporvement also. Being from the west coast, I dont know the states on the East coast very well and its hard to learn those just because there are so many that are jammed in close together. If you could learn states based on specific regions, I think that would be extremely helpful.
